## Requirements

Python libraries needed: [OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/), 
                         [NumPy](https://numpy.org/install/), 
                         [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)...


# OpenCV with Python

Python program for Face Recognition and Identification using the OpenCV Library
    -[OpenCV-Training.py](https://github.com/gonarahmaniani/OpenCVwithPython/blob/main/OpenCV-Training.py) for the initial setup and to update files with recognition data;
    -[Test-Face-Recognition.py](https://github.com/gonarahmaniani/OpenCVwithPython/blob/main/Test-Face-Recognition.py) after doing the initial setup to recognize faces (lighter and less precise version);
    -[Final-Face-Recognition.py](https://github.com/gonarahmaniani/OpenCVwithPython/blob/main/Final-Face-Recognition.py) more complete version of the face recognition with the automatic data update feature.


## Implementation

Insert in the [images](https://github.com/gonarahmaniani/OpenCVwithPython/tree/master/images) directory some subfolders containing the photos for recognition.
Then run [OpenCV-Training.py](https://github.com/gonarahmaniani/OpenCVwithPython/blob/main/OpenCV-Training.py) for configuration (creating trainer.yml and \pickles\pickled_image).
